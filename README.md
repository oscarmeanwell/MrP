# MrPlant

This presents the app of an Arduino project. An arduino gathered temperature, humidity, and soil humidity data from custom sensors - it was then uploaded to a server via a PHP script, and then pulled down to this app.

The app visually allowed users to monitor their plants health, and sent them backround notifications when it needed watering or a change in climate.
